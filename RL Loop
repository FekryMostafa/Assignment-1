RL Loop for Marketing

The agent is an AI that is responsible for allocating budget across different advertising channels. 

The main objective of the Agent is to maximize sales within the given budget.

The agent has three primary actions:

1. Invest in TV advertising.
2. Invest in radio advertising.
3. Invest in flyer advertising.
For each action, the agent can decide to allocate a certain amount of money of the total budget. 

The state is the following information:

1. Budget Remaining
2. Time and Day of the week
    - Most people are not going to be watching TV at 11 AM on a Monday, we want the agent to learn that
3. Season
    - Christmas, etc.
    - Weather, people are more likely to stay home when it's freezing so flyers are less relevant
4. Historical ROI
    - If radio advertising hasn't been working well then the agent should learn to avoid it.

Reward
The agent should be rewarded for the maximum ROI. For example, an agent spending $1000 on radio advertising and increasing sales by $10,000 should be rewarded more than an agent spending $10,0000 on flyer advertising and increasing sales by the same $10,000.
I want the agent to have a short to medium-term strategy so the reward period should be 7 days. 

Challenges
- Some state information is much more important than others. The budget remaining state information is a hard limit for example while the days of the week are more subtle. 
- There might not be enough diverse feedback for the agent based on the 7-day strategy.
- An exploitation problem might occur where the agent only focuses on mediums that have had a historically high ROI. 
- There is a lot more information that isn't in the state and not visible to the agent that might affect the outcome and is too complicated to take into account. For example, a news piece discouraging consumers from buying of TV, a competitor releasing a new product, or our own company releasing a new product, etc. 
- There might be a big delay between the release of an advertisement and the ROI. For example, some advertisements only become relevant months, years, or decades later.
